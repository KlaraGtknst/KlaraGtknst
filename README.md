# Hi there, I'm Klara M. Gutekunst ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Kassel. 
My interests lie in machine learning, data analysis, Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. 
Feel free to explore my repositories to see the projects I've been working on.

## ðŸ”¬ Research and Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been involved in:

  *Repository:* [bachelor-thesis](https://github.com/KlaraGtknst/bachelor-thesis)  
  *Description:* This repository contains the written work on my Bachelor thesis, focusing on identifying key information using topic analysis techniques.

- **Discord Detection in Time Series Data**  
  *Repository:* [discord_detection](https://github.com/KlaraGtknst/discord_detection)  
  *Description:* A project to identify discords in time series data using the HOT SAX methodology.

- **Approaches for Finding Sample Pairs in Contrastive Learning**  
  *Repository:* [master-seminar-ies](https://github.com/KlaraGtknst/master-seminar-ies)  
  *Description:* Work from my Master seminar focusing on methods to find sample pairs in contrastive learning, conducted under the Intelligent Embedded Systems chair.

- **Text topic**
